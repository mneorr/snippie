# Snippets backup-import & Cheatsheet generator
#### For Xcode.
You can __browse snippets__ from my xcode-arsenal in the __readable_snippets__ directory above.

Below is the auto-generated cheat-sheet from your own exported snippets.
It's created every time you back up your snippets and push to git.

### Installation
Fork the repository, to be able to export your own snippets and cheat-sheet. <br>
You can save the repository wherever you want. <br>
`$ git clone https://github.com/mneorr/snippie.git xcode-snippets` <br>
`$ cd xcode-snippets` <br>
`$ bundle install`

### Standard usage
``$ rake backup`` <br>
This will clear my snippets, and put yours in the repository.

It will also generate readable snippets in the __readable_snippets__ dir.
And, it will re-create this file.

After you do backup, `commit` and `push`, and you should have your fork up and ready.
The cheat-sheet will be updated as well.

### Import
##### to your other computers, or a new OS installation
The simplest thing you can do is:
<br>
`$ rake import`
<br>
It should not duplicate the same snippets.

However, if you want to clear the existing snippets, and use the fresh ones, you may want to use <br>
`$ rake clean_import`
